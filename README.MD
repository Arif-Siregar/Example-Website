# Project description
The project involves the improvement and upgrade of a free-to-use web application called Binfluence (developed by GreenQueen). The application is designed to assist users in Australia in learning about proper waste management and finding suitable disposal locations based on their location. Binfluence, the main website, is a platform that shares these information to the general public. A CMS is also developed to enable councils, owner's corporations, and companies to update information such as disposal rules, schedules, and locations (which are displayed via Binfluence). 

The improvement for this system includes:  
    * bin calendar  
    * notifications  
    * bin management  
    * language options

# A note on current repository's status
Our team is co-developing alongside team GR-Koala on the basis of the code provided by GreenQueen. In Sprint 1, we conducted requirements analysis and develop the artefacts to represent our findings. Project development will begin from Sprint 2.
